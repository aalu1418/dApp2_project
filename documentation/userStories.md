**DAPP: Airline MRO + Hyperledger Fabric**

1. The airline maintenance, repair, and overhaul system is done in an outdated manner (non-digital), and this causes problems for accuracy of records, safety of customers, cost of maintenance, and resale value of the aircraft. 
2. Blockchain will be used to accurately track the provenance of parts on an aircraft and the various conditions that the aircraft encounters. This provides a trustworthy record for maintenance crews, and if the aircraft is ever sold, then it's history can be easily proven. The reason to use blockchain instead of a database is because it creates a trust environment where companies can be sure of the provenance of a part or of an aircraft. Hyperledger is preferable over other blockchain networks because it is aimed at industry with permissions, channels, users, etc.
3.1 DAPP should allow users to register as a maintainer or administrator. However, only one administrator per company is allowed.
3.2 DAPP should verify a users login information.
3.3 DAPP should allow the admin to register new aircraft.
3.4 DAPP should allow the admin to assign maintainers to the aircraft.
3.5 DAPP should be able to display specific aircraft information and maintenance needs to user.
3.6 DAPP should allow the maintainer update records about the aircraft.

3.7 DAPP should allow the maintainer to swap parts associated with the aircraft.
3.8 DAPP should be able to display part lifetime information to the user.
3.9 DAPP should allow the admin to sell an aircraft to another company.

3.10 DAPP should be able to track IoT device data from the aircraft (future implementation)
3.11 DAPP should be able to use machine learning to analyze IoT and maintenance data and return it to the user in an understandable manner (future implementation)
3.12 DAPP should meet all necessary requirements for tracking maintenance records (future implementation)
